# MyLove 
I really don't know if this is the one you're working on.
Though I'm not a good coder unlike you, but still tried to make you a bit happy.😬
I just wanted to tell you it's okay to be not okay sometimes.
I know you've been working so hard lately, but please don't be so harsh on yourself.
It's okay to be tired after a hectic and heavy day.
I'm proud of you for being strong on your own.
Ik you weren't too vulnerable infront of me purposely as you know I get affected whenever you're low.
I want you to know that I'll be here for you nmw even against all the odds, having your back.
You're an incredible person and you deserve the world.
Every day you're strong, determined, creative, and constantly productive, despite your mind telling you to be otherwise.
I'm blessed to have you in my life.
Despite the distance between us, you're one of the people I'm closest with, and I'm eternally grateful that you're in my life. 
This is just a hard patch which will pass by the sooner.
Atleast for now sending virtual hugs and kisses which Ik you need badly rn.
You're my brave, intellectual and punctual person, okay?👀
Sending more stength to you, we're meeting the sooner.
Please, please, please... smile karde, I really love your cute smile!
Things are just gonna be okay w time, alright?👀
Ik khup bore kela😅
Buggy Loves You❤️
